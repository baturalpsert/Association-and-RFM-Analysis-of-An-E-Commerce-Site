# Association and RFM Analysis of An E-Commerce Site

## What Is Market Basket Analysis?
 Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.

In this study, market basket analysis was performed with a e-commerce data set containing 2010-2011 data. In this data set, new variables were created as R = Recency, F = Frequency, M = Monetary to perform RFM analysis. Then, customers were divided into 3 segments by clustering using KMeans and the elbow method. Then, association rules analysis was performed by revealing which products customers bought together.
